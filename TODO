Features
--------

complete XQuery Fulltext support
XQueryP support
Grouping support
XSLT 2.0 support
Higher order functions
Support pre-parsed modules


Optimization
------------

Hash map implementation of distinct-values()
nested loop elimination (group recognition, join recognition)
variable inlining
common sub-expression extraction
faster modifiable data model
Document projection for recursive functions
Query option to disable document projection
Option to disable schema validation of input documents
pull event execution


Infrastructure
--------------

query plan output using event API
string pool that returns numeric identifier
support for UTF-8 execution?
extract basic schema types from Xerces-C
abstract schema type access (no direct access to Xerces objects)
Build without code that needs a source version of Xerces-C?
Improve MAPM concurrency
Windows -- re-enable warning 4996 (xqilla_config.h) and address the "unsafe" warnings
	for use of strcat, strcpy, etc


QA
--

fix UTF-16 bugs
fix XQTS bugs
new test suite
test XQuery Fulltext
Fix ATDoubleOrDerivedImpl and ATFloatOrDerivedImpl to use double and float types
Make xs:decimal infinite length
Fix numeric output methods to use variable size buffers
Fix module import to work correctly, including:
  - using the correct static context
  - returning known schema types
  - checking import circularities correctly


Query Prepare Optimization
--------------------------

Don't create a new DynamicContext every time we constant fold (or make creating a DynamicContext cheaper)
Rewrite DatatypeLookup to be cheaper and more efficient - maybe write our own primitive type handling?
DocumentCacheImpl is expensive to create, maybe don't always create a scanner? Maybe handle primitive schema types ourselves?
Remove XQSequence and XQLiteral in favour of XQParenthesizedExpr and ItemConstructor. (Reduce constant folding necessary)
Save out parsed query to disk
