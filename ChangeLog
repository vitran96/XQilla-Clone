XQilla: an XQuery and XPath 2.0 library and command line interpreter.

version 2.0.0 (2007.12.12):
	* Changed the license for XQilla to the Apache License v2, a more
	  permissive open-source licence.
	* Implemented document projection, an optimisation technique that prunes
	  sub-trees of documents not needed for the query at parse time. This is
	  enabled by default.
	* Added a new extension function xqilla:parse-xml() which takes a string
	  and parses it as an XML document.
	* Added optional support for using the FAXPP XML parser instead of the
	  Xerces-C parser.
	* Added a command line option to the "xqilla" utility for binding
	  external variables from the command line.
	* Implemented better error messages for type errors.
	* Modified the embedded MAPM library so we are now using it under the
	  terms of the MIT licence.
	* Fixed miscellaneous bugs in the XQuery Update implementation.
	* Fixed a bug with the algorithm to add and subtract an
	  xs:dayTimeDuration to or from an xs:date.
	* Fixed a bug in XercesNodeImpl which caused a segfault if the node was
	  created as a value of a global variable in another module.
	
version 1.1.0 (2007.08.31):
	* Added support for XQuery Update (Last Call Working Draft, 28 August
	  2007).
	* Added XQillaConfiguration, which encapsulates everything needed to
	  create or use a new data model.
	* Implemented a new data model called FastXDM. It places nodes in a
	  sequential array, and is much faster and more memory efficient than
	  the DOM based data model. This is now the default data model.
	* Implemented XercesConfiguration, to enable use of the Xerces-C DOM
	  based data model.
	* Implemented EventHandler, an event based execution interface. This is
	  used primarily for efficient evaluation of constructed nodes. This can
	  be invoked using XQQuery::execute(EventHandler*,DynamicContext*).
	* Added the ExternalFunction class, to allow users to easily implement
	  XQuery external functions.
	* Added the MessageListener interface, to allow users to easily receive
	  warning and trace messages.
	* Implemented closures, to enable the efficient and lazy execution of
	  "let" expressions.
	* Implemented more lazy execution code for "order by" expressions
	* Added better error messages for sequence type checking errors.
	* Removed the XQDebugCallback API.
	* Rewrote the lexer and parser to be more memory efficient.
	* Rewrote "validate" expressions to be more memory efficient.
	* Modified the XQuery Test Suite runner to run the forthcoming XQuery
	  Update test suite.
	* Made minor changes to allow compilation against the Xerces-C 2.8
	  release candidate.
	* Fixed a bug in the limit checking of the seconds field in the time
	  when parsing.
	* Fixed modules so that the correct language is used to parse the
	  module.
	* Fixed a bug in the code to create a new dynamic context for a
	  module.
	* Fixed possible segmentation faults and memory leaks when using the
	  DOM3 API
	* A number of other miscellaneous minor bug fixes.
	
version 1.0.1 (2007.02.12):
	* Fixed fn:concat() to accept more than 51 arguments.
	* Fixed module parsing, to use the correct language enumeration when
	  parsing. Output modules in the query plan.
	* Fixed a race condition in the parsing of function signatures.
	* Fixed parse errors in the DOM3 API, which were being thrown as
	  XQException instead of XQillaException. [1626534]
	* Fixed the building of shared libraries under Cygwin, by adding
	  -no-undefined to the libtool line in the Makefile. [1639669]
	* Fixed a bug in the static typing of user defined functions, that could
	  result in incorrect errors.
